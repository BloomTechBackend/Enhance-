### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**
    Input is always welcome. Uplifting and encouragement should always be the go-to attitude.

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
    Communication. The issue is tackled and resolved before anything else -
    no glossing over.

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
    
    We make ourselves accountable - but past that: trust.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**

    Identify the problem and find a solution. Negativity isn't needed (and it won't help). 

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
    
    Since this is a one-man team: daily journaling! With an emphasis on 
    clear-cut task completion criteria (and so - clearly defined tasks!). 
    


### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
    
    Learn and understand the value this knowledge will bring to
    an employer. Build a journaling app I'll prefer to pen and paper! 


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
    
    Gaining a better understanding of the development process from planning the testing. 
    Knowledge acquisition - about the tools, challenges, and feelings involved.


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
    
    What's needed to overcome the technical challenges ahead of us (and hopefully
    more!)


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals,
  complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
  
    One-man team = Journal!


## Meaning & Impact

**What is personally important for each team member about joining BloomTech? About
becoming a software engineer?**

* Alessandro: I want to be paid to do something I love. And a love for computing, I am happy to say, is exactly what
    I found through this program!

**What each team member wants to achieve: e.g. improve analytical skills, learn
project management skills, develop public speaking skills, speak up more, speak
up less, etc.**

- Improved problem-solving skills
- Improved sensitivity to pace in a project
- Enlarged and refined technical and behavioural tool-set

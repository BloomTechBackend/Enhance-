## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
  Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
  underway?

Quite closely, but the specifics were all left quite vague, so there was lots of room to learn, adapt (overcome!). And that I most certainly did! Many changes became necessary as time went on and I felt the deadline nearing.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?

I came up with an idea and I asked what components were absolutely necessary for it to work, and worked to implement those and those alone.

* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?

Google, Google, Google. And time off: a good night's rest usually unlocked some new avenue to progress.

* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?

This project was a solo effort.

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
  
This project was a solo effort.

* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?

Overestimated by a good bit. But unexpected and unavoidable life circumstances were mostly to blame for this. I'm still happy with the result.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?

Worry less about the front end. better yet, tackle it first just to dispel that fear of the unknown. 
More generally: don't shrink away from what you don't know. Face it head-on, and as soon as possible.
